**Completion:** <think>
To determine what is necessary for the toy to be played with properly, let's analyze the options:

A: Manual - While a manual might be helpful, it's not strictly necessary for flying the kite.
B: Wind - Kites must be flown in windy conditions to catch the breeze and lift off the ground.
C: Directions - Similar to the manual, instructions might be helpful but are not essential.
D: Marshall - There is no indication of a marshall being involved in the activity.

Given the essential need to take the toy to fly, it's B: wind.

<|im_start|>assistant


**Completion:** <think>
The image shows an elephant with exceptionally large tusks, which is an unusual feature for an elephant. It is unusual because:

1. Elephant tusks typically do not grow to such large proportions.
2. Such large tusks could attract poachers, but which is a serious problem.
3. It is not a grooming habit, as elephants don not use use the tusk for grooming, but but use it by scraping trees.
4. It is not an impossibility but neither is it an abnormality since it is not impossible for an elephant to grow a large tus.

The most likely reason is that these tus are attributes, to poachers.
