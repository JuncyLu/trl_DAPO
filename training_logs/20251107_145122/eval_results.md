**Completion:** <think>
The image shows an elephant with extremely large tusks, which is unusual because elephants typically do not grow such oversized tusks naturally. These tusks indicate that the elephant may have been subjected to selective breeding or other extreme conditions that led to an abnormal growth of tusks. This is not a normal grooming habit or it cannot be impossible.
